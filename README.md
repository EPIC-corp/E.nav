# E.nav

A navigation system in [Starbase](https://www.starbasegame.com/)

My answer to the question: "Where the f*ck am I?"

## E.nav v1.0, what's in it?

E.nav v1.0 includes accurate position and velocity readings using a single receiver. The system is based on a multilateration script using four transmitters from the "starter cluster".
